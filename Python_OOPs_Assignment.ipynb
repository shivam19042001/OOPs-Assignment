        "\n",
        "1️ Code Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
        "   - Allows code to be reused through inheritance, reducing duplication.\n",
        "   - Example: A parent class `Vehicle` can be inherited by `Car` and `Bike` instead of rewriting common properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "2️ Encapsulation (Data Security)\n",
        "   - Protects data by restricting direct access and only allowing modifications through methods.\n",
        "   - Example: A bank account class hides the balance variable and provides controlled access via deposit/withdraw methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3️ Abstraction (Hides Complexity)\n",
        "   - Simplifies code by exposing only essential features while hiding the internal workings.\n",
        "   - Example: A Car object provides a `start()` method, but the user doesn’t need to know how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "4️ Polymorphism (Flexibility & Extensibility)\n",
        "   - Allows the same interface to be used for different types of objects.\n",
        "   - Example: A `make_sound()` method can be used for Dog, Cat, and Cow, but each will have its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5️ Scalability & Maintainability\n",
        "   - OOP makes it easier to add new features or modify existing code without affecting other parts.\n",
        "   - Example: Adding a new vehicle type (`Truck`) to a `Vehicle` class without modifying existing `Car` or `Bike` classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6️ Improved Code Organization & Readability\n",
        "   - Groups related data and methods into objects, making code more structured and easier to understand.\n",
        "   - Example: Instead of handling multiple variables (`name`, `age`, `salary`), an `Employee` class encapsulates all related data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7️ Real-World Modeling\n",
        "   - OOP closely mirrors real-world objects, making it intuitive for designing complex applications.\n",
        "   - Example: A Shopping Cart system with `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order` classes.\n",
        "\n",
